            <p>
              What's up everybody? I'm Ben Merk a.k.a. The Manic Merk! Thanks for popping in on the site! I'm just a normal guy with too much energy to burn who happens to be a
              big fan of his hobbies. Those hobbies include hanging out with my family, spending time with friends, rocking it old school with my table top D&D group, playing
              board games, watching movies, pro wrestling and other shows... and the reason you're probably here is my ABSOLUTE LOVE OF KEYFORGE!

          <h2>Why I Play?</h2>

            <p>
              When I was a teenager I had the best time in the world playing Magic the Gathering with my friends around various kitchen tables. The strategy and creativity of the
              game were unheard of at the time. I was never the best player but I loved putting together bonkers decks cobbled together from the limited collection of cards I
              could afford. Well, those days are long passed, and Magic the Gathering has moved far beyond the kitchen table. Most of the Magic played in my area is now
              competitive play, and living the #DadLife doesn't leave time or money for that kind of play.
            </p>

            <p>
              But then one day I'm scrolling through the interwebs looking up boardgames to add to my growing collection when what do I see? An advertisement for a new "Unique
              Deck Game" which left me wondering whether this was more marketing buzzwordary or a game of actual quality? Well then I saw the low price point to enter and gave
              it a try. After all, it was created by the same man who invented my once beloved Magic. What did I have to lose? As it turns out, more money than I had planned on
              for a game whose initial draw was partially a $10 buy in haha!
            </p>

            <p>
              After giving the game a shot I honestly found it a little lacking. But that was a problem with me, not the game. As it turned out I was trying to play this brand
              new entity in the same way I had played Magic the Gathering. If you're new and joining from any other LCG's or CCG's I encourage you to recognize that Keyforge is
              more chess than it is standard card game combat. That element can be there, but it will seldom move you closer to winning the game. The moment I fell in love with
              Keyforge was the moment I stopped trying to make it be any of the other games of similar style I had ever played. Keyforge presents unique, challening, strategic
              decision making opportunities. It is at its core a resource management racing game. It creates a myriad of ever changing options between playing cards from your
              hand and playing the cards you have on the board in front of you. I have loved the fact that the decks can't be changed. Keyforge has forced me out of my player
              comfort zone as I have explored different decks of various play styles that I would never have built for myself in other games. It's made me a better player. It
              challenges me to think outside of the box and challenges my preconceived notions about what a game in this space should be like. I love Keyforge because of the game
              but also because of the rich and encouraging community that I've grown to know and love.

            <p>
              And that, is why I play.

            <h4>The Master Vault</h4>
              <p>
                If you haven't started playing the game then you may not know that each deck is scanned into a global database at the Master Vault. It's super easy, barely an
                inconvenience (I love <a href="https://youtu.be/OEaSnmf1JwY" target="_blank">Pitch Meetings</a> on YouTube! Unrelated to Keyforge but hilarious!).

            <h4>The Crucible Online</h4>
              <p>This is where most of my games are played. A solid online adaptation of the game with minimum wait times, and all for the low low cost of... FREE!!</p>
